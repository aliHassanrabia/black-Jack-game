## Project plan

By creating a java script, html and css files im going to build a black jack game that a person can play with a dealer and when you enter the game you will have a fix amount of money that u can use it to bit then the dealer will start giving the cards and you can see the sum of your cards and the dealers cards and then you can double or stand or hit from the buttons given after that the dealer will reveal the rest of his cards at the end we have one busted which can be you or the dealer depends on your cards if you win you will double your bit and if you lose you will lose your bit.


## Pseudo code

First when you enter the game and you will have a credit of 500$ on your wallet

Second thing the minimum bit will be 50$ and you can change it.

Then after you decide how much your bit will you will press the bit button to start.

The dealer will start give the cards randomly.

The total sum of the cards will appear in the block for both the player and the dealer.

After that you can choose to double or stand or hit.

After that the dealer will reveal his cards.

And then we will see who is busted and looses.

If the dealer lost you will get double the amount of bit you put.

If the dealer won you will lose your bit.

After that you can start playing again by arranging the amount of bit you want and press bit.
